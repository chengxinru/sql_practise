timestamp, callerid, receiverid, length
1. 找出在20190101 这一天的新用户。新用户可以是打过电话的人，也可以是接过电话的人。

WITH df1 
AS
(SELECT callerid AS id, date(timestamp) AS time
FROM df
UNION ALL
SELECT receiverid AS id,date(timestamp) AS time
FROM df)

SELECT id
FROM
(SELECT id, MIN(time) AS first_usage
FROM df1
GROUP BY 1)
WHERE first_usage = '2019-01-01'

2. 对这一天的新用户，算出之后每一天的retention rate，直到今天，例如
day, retention rate
1, 0.9. 1point3acres
